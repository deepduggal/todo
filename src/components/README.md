# Components

The components folder contains reusable components that are meant to be used within UI views of the web app. 

The components folder contains: 

- **A *_components.js* file** that exports all higher-level components. 

- **Top-level Components**: Each directory that is a 1st-child of the components folder contains a top-level component. 

- All other components (not in a subdirectory) are reusable components that are used within these top-level components.
